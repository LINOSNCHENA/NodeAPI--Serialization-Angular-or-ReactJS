#  NodeJS-and-MongoDB/MySQL

The API is processing data in the engine of the database. Therefore, the usage is split with much of the processing done in the database engine. The middle-ware constructs statements and then these constructed statements are transported to the database where the database engine execute them. 
Therefore, the computational load in mostly on the database engine.
